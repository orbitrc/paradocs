# Paradocs

Paradocs is a tool for generating Markdown documents based on Doxygen XML output, specifically
for Primer and Blusher.

## Usage

Create a `paradocs.xml` file and use the `paradocs` command in the same directory.

## paradocs.xml

which classes should be documented and which files should be input.

All `paradocs.xml` files starts with \<paradocs\> root tag.

- name: Name of the project.
- description: A brief description of the project.
- docdir: The directory path of XML files generated by Doxygen.
- outdir: Output directory. Default value is `paradocs`.
- basepath: If this is set, Paraocs will prepend this path to the links. Default value is `/`.

### \<category\>

A **category** tag organize the classes. It must contain one **name** tag, which have a unique
value within the project.

### \<class\>
